# MyPage
Created a GitHub page for fun! Taking advantage of the free GitHub Pro that comes with being an Emory student and making my own "website."

Utilized a flex-box layout that I learned from the Meta course HTML and CSS in depth course offered on Coursera. Includes some interactive animations with CSS. 

Will slowly edit more as time passes. Planning on upgrading the simple HTML site with React to improve it towards a Single Page Application. Updates coming soon as I slowly progress through the React Basics course on Coursera offered by Meta.
